This file is basically a todo list for the project.

TODO List
=========
Front Page
----------
    - [ ]   A view similar to the client view should be displayed, when a channel, server, person is selected
            information should be displayed on the right.

    - [ ]   There should be a menu column on the left side, with links to different places of the web app.

Permissions
-----------
    - [ ]   A permission system to allow registered users to access parts of the site that should not be available to
            everyone.

    - [ ]   A ban button, will need the right permissions.

    - [ ]   Kick button, will need the right permissions.

    - [ ]   Restart TS button, will need the right permissions.

    - [ ]   Groups to manage users.

Other Features
--------------
    - [ ]   Vote kick button.

Normal Users
------------
    - [ ]   Registration is tied with TS ID. When registering a link is sent over TS
            to the user, and registration is done then. Has to be researched to see if easily doable.

    - [ ]   A user may have several TS IDs tied to one account because of multiple devices. This works in the same
            way as above, but uses has to enter a password for the account as well. Don't want people to add others IDs
            to their account.

Administration
--------------
    - [ ]   Restart server.

    - [ ]   Kick, ban etc.

    - [ ]   Create and change channels.
